# TicTacToeAI
This is a experimental AI that I was trying to build by myself by listening a lecture from harvard CS50 in which the lecture showed the main algroithms needed to make a game such tic-tac-toe etc.. I have used all my knowledge about coding and python programming that I had until this far but now I have become stagnant and cant figure out what I need to do next. The CS50 course was very helpful but I still cant wrap my head about the MinMax algroithm that they have used and especially the way they wrote the psueodo code that they have given (v=-infinity). I have not done a lot of research about doing this kind of a tic-tac-toe AI but the videos I have seen in YouTube are all having some pre-defined data arrays for winning states and losing states etc.. I belive I have coded mostly correct as per the lecture but I really want any suggestions that I could use, so that I can improve my program. Pss I am learning Artificial Intelligence so that I could make my dream project come true.

Thanks in advance!
